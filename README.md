Regarding your first query, the CEO has asked for a revenue trend to determine whether retail sales are seasonal. 
According to the data, there are several months of the year that have significant development. According to the 
statistics, the first eight months of sales from January to August were very stable, with an average of $685K (Six 
hundred eighty-five thousand US dollars) in revenue per month. The increase in revenue begins in September, when 
it grows by 40% over the previous month. This pattern persisted up until November, when it rose to 1.5 million US 
dollars, the largest amount of the whole year. Unfortunately, since the data for December is insufficient, no 
inferences can be made from it. This research demonstrates how seasonality—which generally happens in the last 
four months of the year—affects retail store sales.

The top 10 countries with the most potential for growth are represented in the second graph. Since the UK already 
has a large demand and I understand you are more interested in nations where demand may be boosted, the UK is 
not included in these statistics. According to the data, sales of units and income are quite high in nations like the 
Netherlands, Ireland, Germany, and France. To guarantee that steps are taken to further seize these markets, I would

The top 10 consumers who have made the most purchases from the business have been the subject of the third 
study. According to the statistics, there are not many differences between the top 10 consumer purchases. The fact 
that the highest revenue-producing consumer only spent 17% more than the second highest demonstrates that the 
company does not rely solely on a small number of consumers to generate income. This demonstrates that 
consumers' ability to negotiate is limited and that the state of business is positive.

The map chart concludes by comparing the places that have produced the greatest revenue to those that have not. 
Apart from the UK, it is clear that nations like the Netherlands, Ireland, Germany, France, and Australia generate large 
profits, and the company should invest more in
